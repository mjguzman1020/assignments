# Variables
# Check the memory address of var1 by using the following statement Var1=10
print(hex(id(var1))) 
0x7ff8addb74c8

# Check the memory address of var1 by using the following statement Var100
0x7ff8ca5c8008

You should see two distinct addresses for var1. Explain why there are two different addresses and what happened to the first one.
NameError: name 'var1' is not defined. Did you mean: 'vars'? The first one was not defined so it had an error.
the secont one had a number so the code worked.

# Find out the memory addresses of each character in str1 and str2.
str1 = "Hello"
print(hex(id("Hello"[0]))) 0x7ff8b5026b30
str2= "World"
print(hex(id("World"[0]))) 0x7ff8b5026e00
