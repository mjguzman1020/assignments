# Variables
# Check the memory address of var1 by using the following statement Var1=10
print(hex(id(var1))) 
0x7ff8addb74c8

# Check the memory address of var1 by using the following statement Var100
0x7ff8ca5c8008

You should see two distinct addresses for var1. Explain why there are two different addresses and what happened to the first one.
NameError: name 'var1' is not defined. Did you mean: 'vars'? The first one was not defined so it had an error.
the secont one had a number so the code worked.

# Find out the memory addresses of each character in str1 and str2.
str1 = "Hello"
print(hex(id("Hello"[0]))) 0x7ff8b5026b30
str2= "World"
print(hex(id("World"[0]))) 0x7ff8b5026e00

print(hex(id(str1[0])), hex(id(str1[1])))  # where 0 is the first index and 1 is the second index
# Use the same method as described above to find the addresses of additional characters and complete the table below.
0x7ff8b5026b30
0x7ff8b50270a0

Let the variable x be dog and the variable y be cat. Write the values returned by the following operations: Try solving without writing in Python.

x= "dog"
y= "cat"
print(x+y)
# "the " + x + " chases the " + y
print("the " + x + " chases the " + y)

# x * 4
print(x * 4)
If x = 50. Use an assignment statement to increment the value of x by 1.
# Write your code here
dog
dog
dogcat
the dog chases the cat
200
Please troubleshoot the following issue without using Python, and explain your reasoning.

a. hello = "hello" b. _var = 100 c. !var_1 = 200 d. print = "print me" e. False = 0
Please troubleshoot the following issue without using Python, and explain your reasoning.

print("hello")    _var = 100     _var_1 = 200       print("print me")     print(False == 0)
